            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Alexander Scottish</strong>, a passionate and dedicated developer with a deep understanding of web technologies. Over the past 5 years, I've had the privilege of working as an ICT Lecturer, where I not only honed my technical skills but also helped students develop their own understanding of the digital world.</p>

        <p>My journey as a developer started during my university years when I was fascinated by how web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript could bring ideas to life on the screen. Since then, I have gained hands-on experience in various programming languages and frameworks, focusing on building modern, responsive, and scalable websites.</p>

        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>As a web developer, I specialize in building responsive and accessible websites that deliver a seamless user experience across devices. I have a strong grasp of front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I am comfortable working with frameworks like React and Angular. Additionally, I have experience working with back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases like MySQL and MongoDB.</p>

        <h3>Why I Do It</h3>
        <p>I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I believe in creating digital solutions that not only look great but also provide meaningful value to the end users. I find immense satisfaction in the process of turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications that can have a lasting impact on people’s lives.</p>

        <h3>My Vision</h3>
        <p>In the future, I aim to work on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible with technology. I want to continue developing my skills, learning new tools, and applying them to real-world problems. I am particularly excited about working on projects that focus on accessibility and making the web a more inclusive place for all users.</p>
